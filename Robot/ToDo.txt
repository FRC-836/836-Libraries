add equality operators for all the classes: robot, subsystem, and command
add checks in the add command and add subsystem Vis that check to make sure the value being added doesn't already exist
in subsystem constructor, add a default command determiner VI reference that returns the most recently sent command
  this VI is purely for if the subsystem doesn't take one in. if a command determiner VI is provided, it should be used.
add setter in subsystem for setting the command determiner
  allows for dynamic changing of how commands are processed, useful if we want to process them differently in auto than tele
add ability for each command to know where it was sent from.
  probably add a private field "calledFrom" and every in sendCommand the field gets populated with a callChain.VI or something
  
consider making subsystem a friend of command.
