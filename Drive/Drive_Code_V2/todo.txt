update control_loop/completely re-work control loop to be cleaner
make sensor code more generic
  have ability to create sensors on the fly
    named sensors that take a value of a type
    possibly stored in a map to RT FIFOs
  each command can utilize sensors as necessary
  
add sensor value update VIs

create cluster that contains all possible drive values
  e.g. X, Y, rotation, left, right
  this will be useful for the portion of the drive loop that routes the PID output to the drive value set VI

create VIs for each drive train that perform the commands
  each VI will have a switch statement inside of it that switches based on command
  command will perform the actions necessary to perform the action
    calculate setpoints

Figure out how to handle drive values when the PID and Period update commands are sent
  driving shouldn't stop due to these commands
  possible solutions
    write previous values through
    send most recently sent command before PID/Period update commands sent immediately after the PID/Period update command
    
add tolerances to the command finished checking for the notifier
  this should be handled in the drive train process command VIs
  
update TankProcessCommmands.vi to utillize the actual left right of the tank drive system instead of passing everything through cheesyDrive
