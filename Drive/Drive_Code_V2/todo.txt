update control_loop/completely re-work control loop to be cleaner
make sensor code more generic
  have ability to create sensors on the fly
    named sensors that take a value of a type
    possibly stored in a map to RT FIFOs
  each command can utilize sensors as necessary
  
add sensor value update VIs

create cluster that contains all possible drive values
  e.g. X, Y, rotation, left, right
  this will be useful for the portion of the drive loop that routes the PID output to the drive value set VI

create VIs for each drive train that perform the commands
  each VI will have a switch statement inside of it that switches based on command
  command will perform the actions necessary to perform the action
    calculate setpoints
